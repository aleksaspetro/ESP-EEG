# Why Cerelog's ESP-EEG? 

## Easy to use Software compatability:

## Compatable with **OpenBCI Gui (Custom fork)** via **Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) ** protocol [(What is LSL?)](https://labstreaminglayer.org/#/) 


<img src="IMG_3756.jpg" alt="Demo" width="500">


Setup instructions and LSL Custom Python connection script :  [Here](https://github.com/Cerelog-ESP-EEG/How-to-use-OpenBCI-GUI-fork)


A modified OpenBCI Gui has been forked above so you can visualize data easily and stream to other platforms. This works with it's LSL streaming capability via a special python script (in link above)!

ESP-EEG’s Python client software can stream data via the standard neuroscience software communication protocol Lab Streaming Layer. This means you can stream  directly to your favorite neuroscience software or Matlab running on your laptop or remote computers, record data streams, and integrate ESP-EEG's data with other data streams.

## Stream data to Brainflow API for complex data analysis :

Instructions on how to collect data from device with Brainflow API custom instance: [Here](https://www.cerelog.com/eeg_researchers_guide.html)

and

Custom instance of Brainflow Repo: [Here](https://github.com/shakimiansky/Shared_brainflow-cerelog) for collecting data with the device. 

Note: Test script to quickly view plot and aquire data -> Run 'Shared_brainflow-cerelog/python_package/cerelog_tests/filtered_plot.py' from in above repo. (Must download and run with full Brainflow instance to use)


## NEW: WiFI Support - (Beta Testing) - For Use With OpenBCI GUI Fork / LSL

## 📉 Superior Noise Reduction (Closed-Loop Bias)
Unlike many consumer EEG devices that use "open-loop" or passive grounding strategies, the ESP EEG implements a **True Closed-Loop Active Bias** (Drive Right Leg).

*   **The Problem:** Many competitors leave the bias feedback loop open, rendering the noise cancellation ineffective against movement artifacts and 50/60Hz hum. Their bias pin effectively becomes the average of the supply rails and acts as a ground on their device making the bias pin not function as effectively intended on the ADS1299 datasheet.
*   **Our Solution:** We utilize the full capability of the ADS1299 to measure the common-mode signal, invert it, and actively drive it back into the body.
*   **The Result:** A significantly lower noise floor and fewer artifacts, allowing for research-grade data capture even in non-shielded environments.

# ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING
**NON-ISOLATED DEVICE: BATTERY OPERATION REQUIRED**

This device **does not** contain galvanic isolation circuitry. To ensure user safety and prevent ground loops:
1.  **ALWAYS** use this device with a laptop running on **BATTERY POWER**.
2.  **NEVER** connect this device to a computer that is plugged into a wall outlet (Mains Power).
3.  **NEVER** use this device on a desktop computer.

Failure to follow these instructions introduces a risk of electric shock in the event of a mains surge and will significantly degrade signal quality due to ground noise.


# Important Notice
