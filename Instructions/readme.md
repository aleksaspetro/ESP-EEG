# 🔌 Part 1: Connecting Hardware & Running a Session


<img src="connecting_photo.jpeg" alt="Connecting Photo" width="1900">

## 1. Hardware Assembly
Connect your EEG cap cable(s) to the required touch-proof adapter(s), then plug the adapter(s) into the electrode headers on the Cerelog board.

## 2. Prepare the Subject
Fit the EEG cap on the subject's head. Apply a small amount of conductive gel into each electrode cavity to ensure good skin contact.

## 3. Connect Reference & Bias (Ear Clips)
For accurate BCI data collection, you **must** use two ear clip electrodes with conductive gel.
1.  Connect the **first ear clip** to the **BIAS** pin.
2.  Connect the **second ear clip** to the **SRB1** pin (this acts as the Ground/Reference in the default montage).
3.  Attach one clip to each earlobe.
4. Pick the channel you want data from, ex ch1 and connect a probe from CH1+ to your head via an electrode

## 4. Connect and Stream

[Note: If you can't connect the computer to the device, read this helpful [troubleshooting guide:](https://github.com/Cerelog-ESP-EEG/Troubleshooting_connection/tree/main )]

Connect the board to your computer via USB-C. Wait for green LED to turn on. 

⚠️ Don't see the LED turn on? 
Sometimes you may need to turn on and off PCB for computer to detect new board. If you do not see this status LED turn on after 10 seconds you need to powercycle with switch. Also, if the LIPO battery is dead you will need to charge it with USB-C. After plugging in a new battery you must also turn on and off the power switch.

**Don't Like USB?:  WiFI Support (Under Dev)**
[More info](https://github.com/Cerelog-ESP-EEG/WiFi_Support)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY REMINDER
As per the notice in Section 1, only connect the device to a laptop running on its own **battery power**.

*   **DO NOT** use this device if the laptop is charging.
*   **DO NOT** connect this device to a desktop computer plugged into a wall outlet.

# Option B (Best) To learn how to use with Brainflow keep reading: 


To get the best performance from the ESP EEG, we recommend using our custom BrainFlow instance. This guide covers installation, the theory behind our data stream, and provides a production-grade script for real-time filtering and plotting.

**2 Quick Videos Using Cerelog ESP-EEG with Brainflow:** Use these videos if you get stuck with the GUIDE BELOW. Make sure to read the instructions below though, as the videos don't have all of the setup command scripts.

# How to use Brainflow [READ THIS!]:

## Step 1: Installation (Custom BrainFlow Instance)

The ESP EEG requires a specific version of BrainFlow to handle its high-fidelity data packets correctly.

1.  **Download the Custom Library:**
    Clone or download the custom BrainFlow repository here:
    👉 **[Cerelog Shared BrainFlow Repository](https://github.com/shakimiansky/Shared_brainflow-cerelog)**

**Seting up the brainflow repo on new computers:**

*   **One-Time Setup:** This compilation is a one-time setup for your computer.
*   **Why compile?** Because the core library is written in C++, it must be compiled specifically for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux).
*   **When to repeat:** You only need to repeat the build process (Step 2) if you modify the underlying C++ source code files (`.cpp`, `.h`). Creating new Python scripts does **not** require a rebuild but it does require running pip install -e. (the last step) before running new python scripts

---

## Step 2: Get the Custom BrainFlow Fork
Our board requires a specific fork of BrainFlow. Clone it and navigate into the new directory.

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Use This Specific Repository**
> This version of BrainFlow contains code specific to the Cerelog board. This code has not yet been merged into the official, main BrainFlow repository. You **must** use the link provided below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shakimiansky/Shared_brainflow-cerelog.git
cd Shared_brainflow-cerelog
```

---

## Step 3: Build the Library from Source
This crucial step compiles the C++ core of the library.
*Tip: If you make a mistake, manually delete the `build` folder and start this step over.*

### 🍎 macOS Users: Install Build Tools First
Before proceeding, you need to install Homebrew (a package manager) and CMake. Open a terminal and run these commands one by one:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install cmake
```

### 🛠️ Compilation Steps (All OS)

**1. Create the build directory:**
Create a new directory named `build` inside the `Shared_brainflow-cerelog` folder and navigate into it.
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```

**2. Prepare build files (Choose your OS):**
Run the correct `cmake` command for your operating system.

*   **For Windows (with Visual Studio 2022):**
    ```bash
    cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
    ```

*   **For macOS / Linux:**
    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```

** Run the Build Command:**
This uses 4 processor cores (`-j4`) for faster compilation.
```bash
cmake --build . --config Release --clean-first -j4
```

---

## Step 4: Install the Python Package
With the core library built, you must install the Python bindings to link your scripts to the C++ core.

**1. Navigate to the python package folder:**
(Move up from the `build` folder and into `python_package`)
```bash
cd ..
cd python_package
```

**2. Install in "Editable" Mode:**
This links the package to the source files, so you don't need to reinstall the pip package if you change python files later. This command only needs to be run once.

*   **Windows / Linux:**
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
*   **macOS:**
    ```bash
    pip3 install -e .
    ```
## Step 5: Dependencies
Ensure you have the required Python packages installed:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pyserial plotly dash scikit-learn "setuptools<82"
# Note: brainflow must be installed/referenced from the custom repo above
```


## Step 6   Run Test Script

The script below (`filtered_plot.py`) relies on the bindings found in the Brainflow repository. You must run the script **inside** that repository's environment or install the Python bindings from that source.

##  Run the Script
Below is the complete Python script for robust, real-time plotting. Save this code as `filtered_plot.py` inside your custom BrainFlow folder.

# 📘 Part 3: How It Works (High-Level Overview)

*Please view full setup instructions PDF for more detailed instructions on scripting.*

All BrainFlow Python scripts for this board follow a similar pattern. Here is the architecture of a session:

### 1. Initialize and Configure
*   **`params = BrainFlowInputParams()`**: Creates a configuration object. For the Cerelog board over USB, defaults are usually sufficient.
*   **`board_id = BoardIds.CERELOG_X8_BOARD`**: Selects the specific driver for our hardware.
*   **`board = BoardShim(board_id, params)`**: Creates the main controller object.

### 2. Connect and Stream
*   **`board.prepare_session()`**: Finds the board and opens the serial connection.
*   **`board.start_stream()`**: Tells the ESP32 to start collecting data into an internal buffer.
*   **`board.get_board_data()`**: Pulls the data from the buffer into a NumPy array for processing.

### 3. ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Data Scaling
Unlike consumer toys, the Cerelog board provides **raw, unscaled data** to give researchers maximum fidelity. You **must** apply scaling factors to convert these raw values into standard units.

**If you skip this, your graph will look flat and your time axis will be wrong.**

```python
# --- 1. Scale EEG Data (Vertical Axis) ---
# The board returns data in Volts (V). Convert to microvolts (µV):
eeg_data_microvolts = eeg_data_raw * 1e6

# --- 2. Scale Timestamp Data (Horizontal Axis) ---
# The board's timestamp is raw. Convert to seconds:
time_axis_seconds = (timestamps_raw - timestamps_raw[0]) * 1000.0
```

### 4. Advanced Real-Time Filtering
Reaching clean EEG data requires Digital Signal Processing (DSP). The raw signal contains DC offsets, mains hum (50/60Hz), and movement artifacts.

**The Filtering Chain:**
The script above implements a robust filter chain designed for real-time BCI:
1.  **Detrend:** Removes the DC offset (constant voltage drift) so the signal centers around 0 µV.
2.  **Low-Pass (100Hz):** A 4th-order Butterworth filter that removes high-frequency noise that isn't EEG.
3.  **Band-Stop (Notch):** Specifically cuts out 50Hz and 60Hz noise caused by wall outlets/mains.
4.  **High-Pass (0.5Hz):** Removes extremely slow drifts caused by sweat or head movement.
5.  **Rolling Median:** A final smoothing pass to remove sudden spikes without blurring the signal.
```
